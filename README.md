AI BASED PHISHING DETECTION SYSTEM

The AI-Based Phishing Detection System is an interdisciplinary project designed to identify and prevent phishing attacks across multiple platforms, including emails, URLs, messages, and PDF files. The system uses machine learning and natural language processing techniques to analyze content and detect suspicious patterns. Various algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Decision Tree were implemented and evaluated for accuracy and performance. Feature extraction and data preprocessing played a crucial role in improving model effectiveness. The dataset was compiled from real-world phishing and legitimate sources to ensure model reliability. The solution includes a real-time detection module that flags potential threats before users interact with them. A Flask-based backend handles prediction requests while the frontend, developed using JavaScript, presents results through a user-friendly dashboard. The system enhances cybersecurity awareness and provides a proactive approach to phishing prevention. This project demonstrates the power of AI in automating threat detection. Overall, it contributes to safer digital communication and can be integrated into email clients or web browsers.
